Create Bucket: First, log in to your AWS Console and select S3 from the list of services.
Select Create bucket.
Pick a name of the bucket and select a region. Then select Create.
Bucket names are globally unique, which means you cannot pick the same name as this tutorial.
Region is the physical geographical region where the files are stored. We will use US East (N. Virginia) for this guide.
Make a note of the name and region as we’ll be using it later in the guide.
Then scroll all the way down and click Create bucket.
This should create your new S3 bucket. Before we move on, we need to make sure that our React.js frontend will be able to upload files to this bucket. Since it’ll be hosted on a different domain, we need to enable CORS.
Select the newly created bucket from the list.
Select the Permissions tab
Then scroll down to the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) section and hit Edit.
Paste the following CORS configuration into the editor, then hit Save changes.
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "PUT",
            "POST",
            "HEAD",
            "DELETE"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
