Create a folder named terraform-count-ec2-demo in the home directory and then change (cd) the working directory to that folder. This folder will contain all of the configuration files you'll be working with to launch ec2 instances.
mkdir ~/terraform-count-ec2-demo
cd ~/terraform-count-ec2-demo
resource "aws_instance" "my-machine" {
  # Creates four identical aws ec2 instances
  count = 4     
  
  # All four instances will have the same ami and instance_type
  ami = lookup(var.ec2_ami,var.region) 
  instance_type = var.instance_type # 
  tags = {
    # The count.index allows you to launch a resource 
    # starting with the distinct index number 0 and corresponding to this instance.
    Name = "my-machine-${count.index}"
  }
}
Now create another file under the ~/terraform-count-ec2-demo 
# Creating a Variable for ami of type map


variable "ec2_ami" {
  type = map

  default = {
    us-east-2 = "ami-0416962131234133f"
    us-west-1 = "ami-006fce872b320923e"
  }
}

# Creating a Variable for region

variable "region" {
  default = us-east-2
}


# Creating a Variable for instance_type
variable "instance_type" {    
  type = string
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}

cd ~\terraform-count-ec2-demo
terraform init
terraform apply
